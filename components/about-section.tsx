             Hi, Iâ€™m Manish, the voice behind Mizaazi. Iâ€™m a versatile singer inspired by the legendary KK, and I love performing Sufi, Bollywood retro, and timeless favorites.
            </p>
             <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground mb-4 sm:mb-6">
              Music has always been more than just sound to meâ€”itâ€™s my escape, my therapy, my life. With a mix of classical training and modern vibes, I bring emotion and energy into every performance, whether itâ€™s a cozy acoustic session or a big stage show.</p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground mb-4 sm:mb-6">
              Iâ€™m also the lead singer of my band and play the acoustic guitar, which lets me connect with the audience in a raw and soulful way.  </p>
           <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground  mb-4 sm:mb-6">
             For me, Mizaazi is not just a nameâ€”itâ€™s a journey of turning emotions into melodies and creating moments that people can carry in their hearts forever.  </p>
